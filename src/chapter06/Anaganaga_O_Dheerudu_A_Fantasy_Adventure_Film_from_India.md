Anaganaga O Dheerudu is based on the concept of Navarasas, or the nine emotions in Indian aesthetics. The film explores the themes of love, courage, compassion, wonder, disgust, fear, anger, peace and joy through its characters and situations. The film also draws inspiration from various Indian folk tales and epics, such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.
 
The film was a passion project for director Prakash Kovelamudi, who wanted to create a fantasy film that would appeal to both children and adults. He collaborated with his father K. Raghavendra Rao, a veteran filmmaker in Telugu cinema, who co-wrote the screenplay and supervised the production. The film was also a milestone for Disney India, as it marked their first foray into regional cinema and their first live-action film in India.
 
The film features a talented cast of actors who bring their characters to life. Siddharth, who is known for his romantic roles, plays a different kind of hero as Yodha, a blind warrior who relies on his senses and skills. Shruti Haasan, who is the daughter of actors Kamal Haasan and Sarika, plays Priya, a spirited gypsy woman who falls in love with Yodha. Lakshmi Manchu, who is the daughter of actor Mohan Babu, plays Irendri, a ruthless queen who uses dark magic to rule Sangarashtra. Ravi Babu plays Ghatotkacha, a loyal friend of Yodha who can transform into a snake. Harshita plays Moksha, the innocent girl who holds the key to Sangarashtra's fate.
